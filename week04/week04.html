	<h1>Here is the link to the <a href="page1.html">website</a>.
        <h1>Continuity</h1>
        <p>Guideline:
<a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html">
        Here</a> <br>
        Rationale: I changed the color in the background of math tricks in
        h1 of page2 to midnightblue to keep it more with the color scheme of the
        webpage. I also switched it to be a back ground in the logo instead.</p>
	<h1>Navagation</h1>
	<p>Guideline:
<a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">
	Here</a><br>
	Rationale: I put the logo on the second page and made it link back
	to the first. It's important in site navagation.</p>
	<h1> Contrast </h1>
	<p> Guideline: 
<a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html">
	Here.</a><br>
	Rationale: I changed the back ground color to gray to create better
	contrast with the rest of the font colors. </p>
	<h1>Continuity</h1>
	<p>Guideline:
<a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html">
	Here.</a><br>
	Rationale: I moved h3 on page2 to the bottom which is a link back
	to the first site. I kept it because it felt like a good add. I also
	changed the posistions of several elements to make it look more
	appealing to the eye.
